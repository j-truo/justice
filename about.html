          hi, i'm jessica truong !! in the past couple weeks, i had the amazing
          opportunity to participate in a summer program where i was able to
          learn the basics of creating websites from pure code. i went beyond
          the program to teach myself more in my free time in order to complete
          this project. i know i could've easily created a website using much
          simpler avenues like wix, carrd, etc, but i was really curious to see
          what i was capable of without that extra help.
          <br />
          <br />
          in the past week, still a fresh amateur in computer science, i
          thought, “what better way to practice coding at this time than
          dedicating my website to current issues?” hours upon hours of
          commitment and 1,147 lines of code later, i’ve finally accomplished
          what i had set out to do.
          <br />

          <br />
          this website is a compilation of resources i've come across fairly
          recently pertaining to blm, yemen, lgbtq+, indigenous peoples, and so
          much more. the purpose of this was to provide resources to various
          issues in one easy-to-navigate area in which people can come back to
          at their discretion.
          <br />

          yes, the movement "hype" is dying down, but that doesn't mean you
          should stop educating yourself and taking action. continue to use your
          privilege for the better but remember to take necessary breaks and
          heed to your mental and physical health ! i encourage you to explore
          thoroughly and find yourself more knowledgeable and applicable to
          these movements. do NOT fall under the illusion that you're an
          advocate if you refuse to be intersectional. if you have something
          that could be added to this website, feel free to let me know !! my
          insta is @j.truo

          <h6>
            intersectionality \in-tər-ˌsek-shə-ˈna-lə-tē\ : the complex,
            cumulative way in which the effects of multiple forms of
            discrimination (such as racism, sexism, and classism) combine,
            overlap, or intersect especially in the experiences of marginalized
            individuals or groups (merriam-webster).
